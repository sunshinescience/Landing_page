## Landing Page Project
The project involved building a multi-section landing page that dynamically added a navigational menu to the Dom based on the amount of content. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the screen scrolls to the section, which is also highlighted. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was utilized for this project.
